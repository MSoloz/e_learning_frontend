# angular-material-nav

This project was created so I could research how to render a **_horizontal_** navigation bar for use with routing in Angular using Angular Material components.

I had previously figured out how to do this using Angular plus [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) in a similar [project](https://github.com/fmorriso/Angular-bootstrap4-nav).

The biggest obstacle I faced was that all the examples of navigation in Angular Material used **_vertially oriented_**, sidebar navigation (fixed or fly out).

I could not find a single example on the Angular Material website on how to create a **_horizontally oriented_** navigation bar.

## Major software used in this project:

- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) - to create the project.
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - to drive the application
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/components/categories) - for pre-styled widgets
- SCSS (mostly colors) because the whole point of using a canned set of SCSS/CSS such as Angular Material or Bootstrap is to avoid getting "tangled in the weeds" of home-brew custom SCSS/CSS.
